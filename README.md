# Wine-quality-prediction
The information of this wine dataset was obtained through a chemical examination of three distinct varietals of wine produced in the same Italian region but cultivated in a separate area. Thirteen components that were present in each of the three types of wines were analyzed to establish their relative amounts. We have to predict the type of wine using these features.
